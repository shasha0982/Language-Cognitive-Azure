Bike sharing systems, which allow users to rent and return bikes at any location, are gaining interest due to their role in traffic, environmental, and health issues. The data generated by these systems is highly correlated with environmental and seasonal settings, making them attractive for research. The dataset is based on the two-year historical log from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA, from 2011 and 2012. The data is aggregated on two hourly and daily basis and includes weather and seasonal information. The dataset can be used for regression and event and anomaly detection, and can also be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms. The dataset includes various data fields and is licensed under a specific license.",
