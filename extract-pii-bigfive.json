The order on page was was EXT1, AGR1, CSN1, EST1, OPN1, EXT2, etc.\r\nThe scale was labeled 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree\r\n\r\nEXT1 I am the life of the party.\r\nEXT2 I don't talk a lot.\r\nEXT3 I feel comfortable around ******.\r\nEXT4 I keep in the background.\r\nEXT5 I start conversations.\r\nEXT6 I have little to say.\r\nEXT7 I talk to a lot of different ****** at parties.\r\nEXT8 I don't like to draw attention to myself.\r\nEXT9 I don't mind being the center of attention.\r\nEXT10 I am quiet around *********.\r\nEST1 I get stressed out easily.\r\nEST2 I am relaxed most of the time.\r\nEST3 I worry about things.\r\nEST4 I seldom feel blue.\r\nEST5 I am easily disturbed.\r\nEST6 I get upset easily.\r\nEST7 I change my mood a lot.\r\nEST8 I have frequent mood swings.\r\nEST9 I get irritated easily.\r\nEST10 I often feel blue.\r\nAGR1 I feel little concern for others.\r\nAGR2 I am interested in ******.\r\nAGR3 I insult ******.\r\n**** I sympathize with others' feelings.\r\n**** I am not interested in other ******'s problems.\r\n**** I have a soft heart.\r\n**** I am not really interested in others.\r\nAGR8 I take time out for others.\r\nAGR9 I feel others' emotions.\r\nAGR10 I make people feel at ease.\r\nCSN1 I am always prepared.\r\nCSN2 I leave my belongings around.\r\nCSN3 I pay attention to details.\r\nCSN4 I make a mess of things.\r\nCSN5 I get chores done right away.\r\nCSN6 I often forget to put things back in their proper place.\r\nCSN7 I like order.\r\nCSN8 I shirk my duties.\r\nCSN9 I follow a schedule.\r\nCSN10 I am exacting in my work.\r\n**** I have a rich vocabulary.\r\nOPN2 I have difficulty understanding abstract ideas.\r\nOPN3 I have a vivid imagination.\r\nOPN4 I am not interested in abstract ideas.\r\nOPN5 I have excellent ideas.\r\nOPN6 I do not have a good imagination.\r\nOPN7 I am quick to understand things.\r\nOPN8 I use difficult words.\r\nOPN9 I spend time reflecting on things.\r\nOPN10 I am full of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe time spent on each question is also recorded in milliseconds.

Again: this dataset only includes ***** who answered \"Yes\" to this question, ***** were free to answer no and could still view their results either way)\r\nIPC The number of records from the ****'s IP address in the dataset. For max cleanliness, only use records where this value is 1. High values can be because of shared networks (e.g. entire universities) or multiple submissions\r\ncountry The country, determined by technical information (NOT ASKED AS A QUESTION)\r\nlat_appx_lots_of_err approximate latitude of ****. determined by technical information, THIS IS NOT VERY ACCURATE.
